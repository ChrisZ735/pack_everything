Build Notes:
-All VMs here were built (or attempted) in VirtualBox
-Issues/possible fixes in comments below each VM
-VMs that we have tried but have yet to boot (see comments and issues for reasoning):
--Security Onion (loads image, but does not fully boot due to SSH password errors)
--SIFT (unable to load from URL on SANS website; likely boots fine but syntax errors prevent it from loading from a local file path)
--FreeBSD (loads image, some kind of install fails and prevents it from booting properly)

Kali Linux: 
-Problem with SSH password (minimize.sh?)

Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop: 
-"Cancel install" takes you to Ubuntu desktop
-No SSH connection here

Ubuntu 20.04 Server: 
-Fully functional; boots normally
-600s boot_wait is adjustable; failure to load SSH in the VM will result in packer SSH timeout

Rocky Linux: 
-Fully functional; boots normally

TrueNAS: 
-Boots normally, but needs to be configured via web browser
-SSH waiting still occurs from packer --> SSH timeout could be adjusted to hours if SSH is not needed (this wil prevent machine from closing automatically once packer does not connect via SSH)

Security Onion:
-Loads an image
-Requires min 99GB for install (will likely need more for operation)
-2 NIC "required", but can run with 1
-4 Cores/12 GB memory required
-SSH Password issues (minimize.sh?)

SIFT: 
-Easy to download from SANS, but link is not copyable (checksum is present though) - recommend downloading the SIFT VM and using a local filepath to boot it up instead of the usual URL method (has not been successful to date, likely due to syntax errors)

pfSense:
-Boots, but checks to see if WAN link is up

Arch:
-Boots normally, but SSH is disabled by default since Arch is minimalist. Currently working on a workaround: use a script with linux commands to enable SSH; increase boot_wait so that script has time to run before packer auto-removes the VM

FreeBSD:
-Image loads; install fails (can't find folder/file, so it doesn't boot)
-SSH errors
