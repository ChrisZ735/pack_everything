# Security Onion VirtualBox Builds

## List of builds

 - **security-onion-base.virtualbox-iso.base**: The base installation with none of the tools intalled on top of it
 - **so-eval.virtualbox-ovf.eval**: An evaluation install. This includes just enough to show off capabilities, but is not meant as a production system
 - **security-onion-standalone.virtualbox-ovf.so-standalone**: A complete standalone system (manager + sensor + search all-in-one). Meant for small networks only, does not scale well
 - **security-onion-mgr-sch.virtualbox-ovf.so-mgr-sch**: A combined manager-search build meant for distributed systems
